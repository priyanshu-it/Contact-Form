## A project incorporating "handwritten" elements in Java Server Pages (JSP) typically refers to a web application where the JSP code, including scripting elements and HTML, is written manually without relying heavily on visual builders or frameworks. 
This approach emphasizes a deeper understanding of JSP syntax, Java integration, and web development fundamentals.
----
## Key aspects of a "handwritten" Java JSP project:
----
## 1 Manual JSP page creation:
Writing the HTML structure directly.
Embedding Java code using JSP scriptlets (<% %>), expressions (<%= %>), and declarations (<%! %>) for dynamic content.
Utilizing JSP directives (<%@ %>) for page configuration, imports, and tag library declarations.
Employing JSP actions (<jsp:include>, <jsp:forward>, <jsp:useBean>) to manage page flow and interact with JavaBeans.
## 2 Java Backend Development:
Developing Java classes (servlets, JavaBeans) to handle business logic, data processing, and database interactions (e.g., using JDBC).
Integrating these Java components with the JSP pages to create a dynamic web application.
## 3 Database Interaction:
Implementing database connectivity using JDBC to store and retrieve data.
Designing database schema and writing SQL queries within the Java backend to manage application data.
## 4 Deployment:
Packaging the project as a WAR file.
Deploying the WAR file to a Java application server like Apache Tomcat.
